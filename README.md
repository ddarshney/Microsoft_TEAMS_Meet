## 📕 Agile methodology used :
 I have used Agile methodology to build my prototype. <br>
 Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprint’s goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable       product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.
 Agile development methodology is a concept that includes different techniques that provide the ability to adapt quickly to new conditions.

-    Research on the resources to be followed in a time -bound manner.
     Made a basic low-level design of the product.
     Learning some web development technologies- JavaScript NodeJS, read about Web RTC and Socket.io to implement real time communication btw 2 users.
     Learning about WebRTC — an open-source framework providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via simple APIs.
-   [Peer JS](https://peerjs.com/) - PeerJS simplifies WebRTC peer-to-peer data, video, and audio calls.
-   [SocketIo](https://socket.io/) - For realtime communication
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Dependency Management
-   [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - Used for version control
-   [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - Used to Deploy Node.js applications

# Running Locally 🖥️
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
You have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine.

After installing node clone the repo by using git

```
git clone https://github.com/ddarshney/Microsoft_TEAMS_Meet.git
       
```
Or you can also download the zip file.

Then open cmd or git bash on the project folder to install some modules that I used to build this project

Install Once

```
npm install
```

[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) For automatically restart the server as a dev dependency (optional)

```
npm i --sav-dev nodemon
```

If you install nodemon the you can use. (devStart script is already added to the package.json)

```
npm run devStart
```
or
```
node server.js
```

- Run the App on 
```localhost:8569```

# Plans for future release 📆
- Adding authentication
- Adding more features like record screen
- Giving admin  ability to mute/ remove other participants.
- Customizing chat feature.
